In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or, in modern Objective-C, with Automatic Reference Counting or ARC).  A classic example involves circular references. Consider two objects, A and B, where A retains B, and B retains A. Neither object can ever be deallocated because each is keeping the other alive. This leads to memory leaks.
